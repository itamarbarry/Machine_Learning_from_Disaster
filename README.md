# 🚢 Machine Learning from Disaster

This repository documents my solution for the **Kaggle “Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster”** challenge - https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a model that accurately predicts a passenger’s survival outcome on the Titanic. This involves determining which passenger features are most predictive of survival and using them to train a reliable binary classification model.

My final optimized **Random Forest** model achieved an accuracy score of **0.78708**, placing the solution in the **top 12%** of more than **16,000** public leaderboard submissions.

## Core Project Steps

Main stages of the workflow include:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Reviewing data quality, distributions, and relationships.
- **Thoughtful Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values using contextual imputation (e.g., inferring age from extracted social titles).
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new informative features from the existing passenger data to improve model performance.
- **Modeling & Optimization:** Training multiple models, evaluating performance, and tuning the final Random Forest classifier.
